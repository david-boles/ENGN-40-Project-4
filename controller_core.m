% Based on current psi, error ([x, y, z, psi] m or radians), error
% derivative, and error integral, calculates thrust in quadcopter units,
% roll and pitch in radians, and yaw acceleration in rad/s^2
function [thrust, roll, pitch, yaw_acceleration] = controller_core(psi, error, error_derivative, error_integral)
